1. Prediction Problems
Queries where the system failed or gave errors specifically in predictive analytics, forecasting, or win
probability:
Query: Will we win PID 17
Error - predict win probability function failure
Query: What is the predicted win rate for all projects submitted in 2025
Pass - Only gives projects submitted in 2025 (does not actually predict individual outcome, just lists the
projects)
Query: List all projects with predicted win > 80% for the healthcare category
Fail - Error, tuple index out of range
Query: Which clients have the highest predicted win rate in their upcoming projects
Pass - No Result (calculations are not meaningful or not implemented correctly)
Query: Find all submitted projects for CLID 1573 with win rate between 75% and 85%
Fail - Error (tuple index out of range)
2. Reasoning/Relation Problems
Queries that failed because the code cannot answer "why?", causal relationships, or relational connections
(reasoning logic):
Query: List projects with the same point of contact as PID 7
Fail - Recognizes PID but can't extract other logic/relation
Query: List lost projects with predicted win > 80%
Fail - Error, can't combine status reasoning with win %
Query: For projects similar to PID 8 (same category and tags), how many have been won vs. lost
historically
Pass - Wrong Result (logic for relation and win/loss reasoning is not correct)
Query: Which clients have lost highest projects
Fail - Error, unable to answer such questions (needs aggregation and comparative reasoning)
Query: List upcoming projects with tags and status similar to previously lost projects
Pass - Default 6 month if future reference not given (logic for similarity and how to compare status/tags is
weak)
3. Aggregation/Statistical Problems
Queries failing due to limits in logic, sorting, grouping, or statistics (aggregation calculation issues):
Query: List top 20 projects by win percentage
Pass - Limit didn't work (sorting/top N logic)
Query: List projects with the same point of contact as PID 7
Fail - Recognized point of contact, but can't aggregate or filter properly
Query: Show all projects with more than 4 tags
Fail - Couldn't understand numeric (tag counting logic fails)
Query: For all projects, show the top 5 tags used most frequently
Fail - Error (aggregation and tag frequency logic broken)
Query: Find project with tag Expansion and Emergency
Fail - Error (tag matching and aggregation logic weak)
4. Similarity/Relatedness Problems
Queries that test "similar/related" logic, where code only has basic tag/category matching:
Query: Find projects similar to 'PID 10', but not in Healthcare request category
Fail - Only checks category/company; can't exclude category correctly
Query: List projects that have the same client and status as PID 25
Fail - Same as above
Query: For projects similar to PID 8 (same category and tags), how many have been won vs. lost
historically
Pass - Wrong Result (relation flawed)
Query: List upcoming projects with tags and status similar to previously lost projects
Pass - Partial logic, not robust similarity
5. Complex Filtering/Combination Problems
Queries with multiple conditions, complex filters, or multi-field requirements:
Query: Identify the year with the highest number of project wins
Fail - Error, aggregation and multi-field grouping needed
Query: Show projects in 2024 won by Company G with win% above 50%
Fail - Error, min price is considered instead of win%, multi-condition logic fails
6. General Logic/Implementation Errors
Queries failing due to general logic, index errors, or improper assumptions:
Query: Find projects similar to 'PID 10', but only those in a different category
Remarks: Only two supported methods, not enough filtering logic
Empty queries: No attempt or errors due to index or range in tuple processing
Summary
Problem Type Description
Prediction Problems Reasoning/Relation Problems Aggregation/Statistical Problems Similarity/Relatedness Problems Complex Filtering Problems General Logic/Implementation Failures in predictive analytics, forecasting, or win probability calculations
Cannot handle causal relationships, "why" questions, or relational connections
Issues with sorting, grouping, counting, and statistical calculations
Basic tag/category matching only; lacks robust similarity logic
Cannot handle queries with multiple conditions or multi-field requirements
Index errors, tuple range issues, and improper assumptions in core logic
